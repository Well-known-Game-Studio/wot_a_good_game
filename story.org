* Introduction

In the diorama scene, you step out of the house at the top of the hill. You hear
someone saying, "Hey sheepherder, come down here!"

Once you get down to the pen (however you want), you find Tam with the sheep out
of the pen. He asks you to get the sheep back into the pen.

Afterwards, you and he go fishing in the pond.

After that he says we should head back up to the house since it's getting late.

** Attack during dinner in the house (single enemy, indoors)
** Multiple enemies attack the sheep, you have to save them
